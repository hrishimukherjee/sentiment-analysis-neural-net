**Authors:** Hrishi Mukherjee, Jonathan Austin

A Convolutional Neural Network trained and tested on a dataset of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews. 
The movie reviews are classified into one of five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive.

- Google's Tensorflow framework in Python used to engineer CNN
- Experimentation done using multiple layers, batch sizes, and filter sizes
- Maximum Classification Accuracy of 63%
- Dataset of size 50,000
